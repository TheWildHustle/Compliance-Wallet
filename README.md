# Compliance-Wallet
The most compliant Bitcoin wallet in the space. 

Welcome to the Compliance Wallet repository! This GitHub project aims to create a unique Bitcoin wallet experience with a focus on compliance and NGU. Our goal is to develop a wallet that prioritizes adherence to regulatory requirements while providing users with an intuitive interface.

Future Features:

1. "Comply to Earn": Incentivize users to follow compliance guidelines by offering exclusive rewards and benefits within the wallet.
2. "Compliance for Compliance": Gives the user the ability to comply for compliances sake

We invite contributors who share our commitment to developing a secure and compliant Bitcoin wallet. If you have ideas, suggestions, or would like to collaborate on this project, please reach out to us. You can contribute by submitting pull requests or opening issues related to the codebase.
